Author: Elmer Fernandez, Daniela Orschanski
Maintainer: daniorsch@gmail.com
Description: This package will compare the sequenced genome of a patient against
"normal" patients, used as references (predefined by doctors), in order to estimate 
the probability that a certain region of the patient's exome presents some 
alteration. 
It uses the ExomeDepth algorithm.
The user will have to provide a file with the sequenced information and he/she 
will get the results in return in an excel format which will include a 
visualization of the results.
